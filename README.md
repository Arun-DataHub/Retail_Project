🛍️ Retail Data Engineering Project

Project Name: AZURE-DATA-ENGINEER---DATABRICKS-PROJECTS

📖 Project Overview

This project simulates a retail data analytics pipeline using Azure Data Engineering tools and Databricks.
The goal is to build an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests transaction data from APIs, processes it in different layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold), and provides business insights via visualization.

🎯 Business Requirements

The retail business wants to analyze its daily sales performance and customer behavior.
Since raw data isn’t readily available, data engineers must create a pipeline that:

1.Fetches transactional data from APIs

2.Stores raw data in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)

3.Cleans and transforms data into Silver datasets

4.Creates Gold aggregated tables for analysis and visualization

📊 Key Business Metrics

3.Store Performance

Rank stores based on total revenue, transactions, and average order value
